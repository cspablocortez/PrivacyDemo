# Privacy Demo

Privacy Demo is an audit on digital privacy.

This repo hosts a series of API tests to show how much data we share with our
web browsing behavior.

As more APIs are implemented, the results will include personal user data, but only data that has been previously shared with third parties during regular web browsing sessions.
